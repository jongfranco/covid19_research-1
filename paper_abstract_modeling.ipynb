    "# Topic Modeling on Research Paper Abstracts\n",
    "Iqra Munawar (M.S. Analytics, NCSU 2020) & Sameen Salam (M.S. Analytics, NCSU 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a massive amount of research related to COVID-19. In this notebook, we implement a couple of different methods to cluster abstracts according to topical similarity. By doing this, we hope to make a large corpus of research like this easily parseable to individual labs and accessible to the general public. In this notebook, we use the K-means approach (based on TF-IDF) and the LDA topic modeling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The original data source used in this analysis comes from the CORD-19 Research Data Challenge hosted on Kaggle. We created our own text pre-processing pipeline (paper_abstract_cleaner.ipynb) and fed the original Kaggle dataset into it to get an output with all original rows and columns plus the extra \"abstract2\" column. This additional column contains the cleaned and modelable abstracts, and is what is primarily used in this analysis notebook. Unfortunately, as of this version, we have not figured out a way to use the Kaggle API for a direct pull or GitHub for large file storage to handle this dataset, so running this code locally from the repo contents would be impossible. If you have a Kaggle account, you can download it locally off of the Kaggle commit output here: https://www.kaggle.com/sameensalam/paper-abstract-cleaner/output. If you do not have a Kaggle account, you will not be able to get the cleaned abstracts, and running the paper_abstract_cleaner notebook in this repo on the original Kaggle dataset would take several hours and brick up your local machine. We will figure out the solution to this problem, hopefully in the next rollout. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pending Items\n",
    "* See if we can make the Mallet LDA perform any better than a 0.56 coherence score.   \n",
    "* Look into summarizing key points made frequently in each topic.   \n",
    "* Make a density plot of documents colored by topic cluster to see the distribution (TSNE or UMAP).   \n",
    "* Dataset storage within the repo via LFS or linkup to Kaggle API for direct access and reproducibility.   \n",
    "* Look into how small abstracts (single short sentence in length) affect models and potential removal strategies.  "

We included bigrams, or pairs of tokens that occur together in more than 20 documents in this case, and eliminated words that occurred in less than 625 times. Using the resulting token ids for the entire corpus and the resulting individual bag of words models for each abstract, we conducted a grid search for the optimal values for the following parameters:  \n",
    "* **Number of topics**- number of topics the model going to assume while looking at each document.  \n",
    "* **Alpha**- The per-document topic distribution. A higher value of alpha tells the model that each document is made up of more topics. \n",
    "* **Beta/Eta**- The per-topic word distribution. A higher value of beta/eta tells the model that each topic includes more words. \n",
    "* **Learning decay**- The rate at which the model \"forgets\" the old weights as it passes through the corpus.  \n",

    "We tried these parameters on both the regular Gensim LDA algorithm and the Mallet implementation via Gensim. The ideal model was selected based on coherence score, which measures how similar the high scoring words are in each topic. Using the final candidate model, we plotted the topic distribution using the pyLDAvis library, a staple for this particular algorithm. "

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Based on our results so far, we have been able to boil all research presented in the CORD-19 Research Data Challenge to five main topics:\n",
    "* **Topic 1**: Cellular and genetic mechanisms of the coronavirus  \n",
    "* **Topic 2**: Testing and symptomatic presentation of COVID-19  \n",
    "* **Topic 3**: Public health measures and epidemiology of the novel coronavirus  \n",
    "* **Topic 4**: Meta-analyses of research/literature review on anything that might have to do with COVID-19  \n",
    "* **Topic 5**: Medical procedures and treatments for COVID-19 and its various complications  \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we will assign these topic labels back to the individual abstracts. We will create topical density plots to show the abstract distribution and how \"soft\" the boundaries are between topics in a more graunular way. We will also implement some type of summarizing algorithm that takes in all abstracts attributed to a specific topic label and breaks it down into the most important sentences and phrases. \n",
