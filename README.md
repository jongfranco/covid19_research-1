# Abstract Analytics for COVID-19 Research
Iqra Munuwar and Sameen Salam  
  
This repository contains our work on cleaning, posturing, modeling, and summarizing abstracts of research papers pertaining to COVID-19. 

# Motivations
We want this public health crisis resolved as quickly and effectively as possible to reduce loss of life and further economic damage. And while neither of us are biologists or public health experts, we wanted to do our piece by taking a stab at distilling and understanding this large body of research. We know that labs tend to work in silos on specific biological, social, or medical phenomena, so the research publications an individual lab consumes tend to have fairly similar subject matter. We also know that labs are too busy to spend so much time reading every single paper that deals with their field of expertise. Additionally, average people may want to see what the science truly says about COVID-19, but may be overwhelmed when confronted by the vast quantities of research. We seek to address the following needs:   
* Cleaning research paper abstracts to reduce the amount of fluff  
* Creating a topic model that can group research papers that have not been labeled with their respective field  
* Extract key insights by summarizing the large body of research abstracts contributing to each individual topic
